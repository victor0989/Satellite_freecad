Oxygen is soluble in many environments, notably in water. Without taking specific precautions, the irradiated target will contain oxygen. For instance, at 1 atmosphere
and 25 ◦C, air-saturated water contains about 2.5 × 10−4 M dissolved oxygen. This concentration increases to ~1.3 × 10−3 M in oxygen-saturated water at room temperature.
The chemistry of oxygen is fundamentally concerned with electron transfers in oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions. As a diradical, molecular oxygen possesses two
unpaired electrons, enabling it to readily react with primary radicals formed during the radiolysis of aerated aqueous solutions, such as e−aq and H• atoms. These reactions proceed as follows [5,20,53,131]:
O2 +e−aq →O2•−
k =2.3 × 1010 M−1 s−1
O2 +H• →HO2• k=1.3×1010M−1s−1,
